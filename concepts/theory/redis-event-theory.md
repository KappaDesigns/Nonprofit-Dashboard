#Events

##Theory

event data stored in a hashmap. each event has a given key based of front end
data-attribute. The events contain key values. the keys will represent some
value to form the event. The event should contain a date, an image, and a text
value.


##Spec

constructor sets fields of event and creates it hashmap in the DB

get event from hashmap using key

set event data from hashmap using passed data

##Testing

1. Create hashmap

2. get all from hashmap

3. set data
